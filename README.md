To secure a message which sent by user by using algorithm to give more security with python
Secure-message-send-by-the-user.
-by Ravi Teja,CBIT,hyd.

This is my project on encryption. Languages included : Python

Goal :
Build-or-change-an-existing-algorithm-to-secure-message-send-by-the-user.

Problem statement :
Let us consider a case where the user sends a text or file from his phone to his friend. The risk of the data being accessed by a third party is high when the data enters the cloud platform. Hence a new method to secure the messages/file is to be done either by building a new algorithm or by modifying the existing one which can give more security and consume less time. The identity of the use must also be verified by using the authentication, verification and validation methodologies.

This project has following parts :
Build or change an existing algorithm to secure message send by the user based on efficiency.
Confirm the identity of the user by entity authentication using verification and validation.
Tools and Algorithms used for analysis
Python Pycrypto Plugin, Encryption modules
